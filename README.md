SourceSwap Asset List
These files are used by the SourceSwap interface to determine which assets are available and to find relevant chain information. 

Please Contact the Source Team on Discord if you would like to list a token and/or network on SourceSwap. All official links will be found at www.sourceprotocol.io

Important Security Info
Before adding any assets, query the contract and ensure it is instantiated from the proper byte code. The metadata should also be checked with sourced q wasm contract <contract-address> to ensure an admin is not set as this could put users liquidity at risk.
